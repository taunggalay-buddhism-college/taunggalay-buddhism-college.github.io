            </div>
            <div class="profile-bio">
                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <p>Early life
                    Ven. Taung Ka Lay Sayadaw was born Saw Phoe Thu to Aung Khin and Nan Sein Hla Khin on Thursday, 14
                    July 1960
                    (the 7th waning day of Warso in 1322 Myanmar era) in Hlar Ka Myin village in Hpa-an Township, Karen
                    State, Burma.

                <h2>Shin Paññāsāmī</h2>
                <p>At the age of 8, he was novitiated on 14 March 1968 (the 7th waxing moon of Tapaung in the 1329
                    Myanmar era),
                    with Sayadaw Badanda Thuriya of Hlar Ka Myin Monastery as the preceptor and his parents as the
                    organizer
                    and supporter of the ordination ceremony.

                    At the age of twenty-one, on 21 March 1981 (the 1st waxing moon of Tapaung in the 1342 Myanmar era),
                    the novice Pinnyathami was fully ordained as a Buddhist monk; his preceptor was Bhaddanda Thuzarta,
                    the Shwebo Kyaung Sayadaw in Hpa-An, and his parents supporting the ordination.</p>

                <h2>Monkhood and awards</h2>
                <p>The pursuit of monastic education by Sayadaw Ashin Pin Nya Tha Mi has been remarkable.
                    He has passed many religious exams, some with honors: The Abhidharma exam,
                    the Pali Pahtamapyan Examinations, the Thuthama Saya exam, the Thaddhama Parla exam,
                    the Pidhakaya Paraku exam, Vinaya exam, and exam for a comparative study of world religions.
                    In addition to these accomplishments, during 1989–1990, he informally learned Sanskrit
                    and Pali from Dr. Zagara Abivansa, the Raza Giri Sayadaw of Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya
                    and Nava Nalanda Mahavihara. Through continuous learning, Sayadaw's relentless efforts
                    to seek wisdom have earned him an Hon. Doctor of Oriental Learning (Ph.D.) in history
                    from the Indian Institute of Oriental Heritage, Kolkata, India in 2013. In November 2022,
                    Sayadaw was awarded the honor of Thiri Pyanchi by the government of Myanmar. On January 4, 2023,
                    Sayadaw was awarded the honor of Agga Maha Kammatthanacariya, the title of 'Great Noble Meditation
                    Master',
                    by the government of Myanmar.</p>

                <h2>Community work</h2>
                <p>The Venerable Sayadaw has also engaged in several other religious and social activities such as
                    preaching
                    the Buddha's sermons, practicing and teaching mediations, renovating pagodas and taking
                    the roles of National Sangha Committee members. He has renovated over 20 ancient pagodas and
                    donated new Hti (umbrella crowns) around the country. He has also founded 10 monasteries and
                    6 Monastic Education Schools in Kayin State to create broader access to education for children
                    in rural areas and build an educated society.</p>

                <p>Since 1993, Sayadaw has engaged in the Karen Peace Council (KPC) as a leading peace negotiator
                    for the peace in Kayin State.[4] He has also served as a patron for the Myanmar Peace Foundation.
                    In 2001, he established a social group called Phlon Education Development Unit (PEDU)
                    and began extensive social and local development works in Kayin State. In 1996,
                    he opened a monastic school for children from kindergarten through tenth grade.
                    He also founded First Aid Groups in partnership with the Myanmar Red Cross
                    and established the orthopedic rehabilitation center in Hpa-an township.
                    On 10 September 2017, a completion ceremony for midwives training was held
                    at the Taung Kalay Monastic School. Sayadaw also awards scholarships to outstanding students.
                    He set up Nat Say Taman Scholarship Funds and provided financial assistance to students in Kayin
                    State
                    while serving as a patron for Karen Student Center (KSC), a boarding school for students
                    from remote villages that lack access to education. In 2009, he went to Australia and established
                    the Karen Melbourne Buddhist Association to promote Buddhism and provide spiritual counseling
                    based on Buddha teaching to the Karen community there. He was officially awarded
                    the honorary titles of Thaddhama Jotika Dhaja in 1991 and Maha Thaddhama Jotika Dhaja in 2001
                    by the government of Myanmar. In 2002, Sayadaw also received the Buddhist Literature Award from
                    Japan.</p>

                <p>Due to his influential impact on the local community, he is frequently visited by politicians,
                    government officials, Karen leaders, KNU officers, and many other local leaders.
                    It is also reported that Taung Galay Sayadaw sent condolences to the passing
                    of Padoh Saw David Taw who was the secretary of the KNU Peace Committee and
                    also a member of a KNU delegation that negotiated peace with the Burmese government in January 2012.
                </p>

                <h2>Activities abroad</h2>
                <p>The Venerable Sayadaw has traveled extensively. He has traveled to India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in
                    1994,
                    Thailand and Singapore in 1997, Japan in 2000, Australia in 2009, and America in 2015,
                    and conducted Dhamma talks with the Myanmar community in those countries as well as to citizens
                    of those countries. His remarkable works for humanity have greatly inspired thousands of people
                    to lead a good life and make a difference in their community and country.
                    With the motto “Toward the peaceful state of Nirvana,”
                    the Venerable Sayadaw Ashin Pin Nya Tha Mi continues
